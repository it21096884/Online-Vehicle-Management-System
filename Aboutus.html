		<p style="text-align:justify">	Good things happen when people can move, whether across town or 
			toward their dreams. Opportunities appear, open up, become reality.
			What started as a way to tap a button to get a ride has led to billions
			of moments of human connection as people around the world go all kinds
			of places in all kinds of ways with the help of our technology.

		<h2 style="text-align:justify"> <b>Sustainability  </b></h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Uber is committing to becoming a fully electric, 
		zero-emission platform by 2040, with 100% of rides taking place in zero-emission vehicles, 
		on public transit, or with micromobility. It is our responsibility as the largest mobility platform 
		in the world to more aggressively tackle the challenge of climate change. We will do this by 
		offering riders more ways to ride green, helping drivers go electric, making transparency a 
		priority and partnering with NGOs and the private sector to help expedite a clean and just energy transition.
		</p>
		<h2 style="text-align:justify"> <b>Rides and beyond</b></h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify">	In addition to giving riders a way to get from point A to point B,
		we're working to bring the future closer with self-driving technology and urban air transport,
		helping people order food quickly and affordably, removing barriers to healthcare, creating new
		freight-booking solutions, and helping companies provide a seamless employee travel experience.

		<h2 style="text-align:justify"> <b>Your safety drives us </b></h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify">	Whether you’re in the back seat or behind the wheel, your safety is
		essential. We are committed to doing our part, and technology is at the heart of our approach.
		We partner with safety advocates and develop new technologies and systems to help improve safety
		and help make it easier for everyone to get around.

		<h2 style="text-align:justify"> <b>  History </b></h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify" >Our short history is the brief history of the collapse of the transport 
		sector in Sri Lanka - for the good of the passenger, the driver.
		<br><br>
		Sulfur Geoffrey resigned as CTO of wow.lk, Sri Lanka's largest e-commerce player, 
		and became interested in his next entrepreneurial journey in June 2014.  
		Collaborating with friends, Sulfur came to a very attractive market: Sri Lanka's transport sector
		was obsolete and needed urgent interruptions.  Technology has shown that the needs of modern citizens 
		and the transport sector can be transformed into a technologically advanced market.
		<br><br>
		Sulfur and his friends spent months preparing the prototype and preparing it for investment.  
		The starting group of three investors was Ajith Gunawardena, Ruchi Gunawardena and Dinesh Rodrigo.  
		Initial Digital Mobility Solutions (Pvt) Ltd.  Investors were immediately interested.  
		As a result of the leasing giant LOLC Group, their CEO joined Pickme Board, 
		and MAS Holdings and the Hirdramani Group also emerged as investors. </p>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:justify"> <b>  Achievement </b> </h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify"> When the first user downloaded the Pikme app, we did not know that she was helping 
			us into a new era in the Sri Lankan technology industry.
			<br><br>
			That was in June 2015. Two years later,
			today we are among the most prestigious victories in the country.
			The largest number of start-ups in the country attracted $ 3 million from business capitalists.
			Rs.  1 billion in revenue and short-term profit
			Doubling every month for the first year of operation - the fastest growing local company
